**Update (06/17/2020):** Major rewrite of previous code, new implementations are compatible with `tensorflow >= 2.2` and are capable of being run both imperatively ('eager execution', the default in `tensorflow 2.x`), and through graph execution, obtained by compiling the necessary functions with `tf.function`. 


A description of the L2HMC algorithm can be found in the paper:

[*Generalizing Hamiltonian Monte Carlo with Neural Network*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.09268)

by [Daniel Levy](http://ai.stanford.edu/~danilevy), [Matt D. Hoffman](http://matthewdhoffman.com/) and [Jascha Sohl-Dickstein](sohldickstein.com)

A detailed description of the ongoing work to apply this algorithm to simulations in lattice QCD (specifically, a 2D U(1) pure gauge theory model) can be found in [`doc/main.pdf`](doc/main.pdf).

# Overview

We are interested in applying the L2HMC algorithm to generate *gauge configurations* for LatticeQCD.    

This work is based on the original implementation which can be found at [brain-research/l2hmc/](https://github.com/brain-research/l2hmc). 

Given an *analytically* described target distribution, π(x), L2HMC provides a statistically exact* sampler that:

- Quickly converges to the target distribution (fast ***burn-in***).
- Quickly produces uncorrelated samples (fast ***mixing***).
- Is able to efficiently mix between energy levels.
- Is capable of traversing low-density zones to mix between modes (often difficult for generic HMC).

# L2HMC for LatticeQCD

**Goal:** Use L2HMC to generate _gauge configurations_ for lattice QCD. 

All lattice QCD simulations are performed at finit lattice spacing a, and need an extrapolation to the continuum in order to be used for computing values of physical quantities.

More reliable extrapolations can be done by simulating the theory at increasingly smaller lattice spacings.

The picture that results when the lattice spacing is reduced and the physics kept constant is that all finite physical quantities of negative mass dimension diverge if measured in lattice units.

In statistical mechanics language, this states that the continuum limit is a critical point of the theory since the correlation lengths diverge.

MCMC algorithms are known to encounter difficulties when used for simulating theories close to a critical point, an issue known as the _critical slowing down_ of the algorithm.

**The L2HMC algorithm aims to improve upon HMC by optimizing a carefully chosen loss function which is designed to minimize autocorrelations within the Markov Chain.**

In doing so, the overall efficiency of the simulation is subsequently improved.

## U(1) Lattice Gauge Theory

We start by considering the simpler (1+1)-dimensional U(1) lattice gauge theory, defined on an Nx * Nt lattice with periodic boundary conditions.

The action of this gauge theory is defined in terms of the *link variables*

and can be written as

<div align="center">
 <img src="assets/action1.svg" alt="S = \sum_{P}\, 1 - \cos(\phi_{P})"/>
</div>
where <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%5Cphi_%7BP%7D"> is the is the sum of the link variables around an elementary plaquette:

</div>
### Target distribution:

- Our target distribution is then given by:

  <div align="center">
  <img src="assets/target_distribution.svg"/>
  </div>
  where Z is the partition function (normalizing factor), β is the inverse coupling constant, and S[ɸ] is the Wilson gauge action for the
  2D U(1) theory.

Lattice methods for the 2D U(1) gauge model are implemented using the `GaugeLattice` object, which can be found at
[`l2hmc-qcd/lattice/lattice.py`](l2hmc-qcd/lattice/lattice.py)

# Organization

## Dynamics / Network

The base class for the augmented L2HMC leapfrog integrator is implemented in the [`BaseDynamics`](l2hmc-qcd/dynamics/base_dynamics.py) (a `tf.keras.Model` object).

The [`GaugeDynamics`](l2hmc-qcd/dynamics/gauge_dynamics.py) is a subclass of `BaseDynamics` containing modifications for the 2D U(1) pure gauge theory,
including a custom [`GaugeNetwork`](l2hmc-qcd/network/gauge_network.py) which is composed of a collection of `tf.keras.layers` objects, each of which can be
found in [`network/layers.py`](l2hmc-qcd/network/layers.py).

An illustration of the `VNet` architecture can be seen below.

Specific details about the network can be found in [`l2hmc-qcd/network/gauge_network.py`](l2hmc-qcd/network/gauge_network.py).

## Lattice

Lattice code can be found in [`lattice.py`](l2hmc-qcd/lattice/lattice.py), specifically the `GaugeLattice` object that provides the base structure on which our target distribution exists.

Additionally, the `GaugeLattice` object implements a variety of methods for calculating physical observables such as the average plaquette, ɸₚ, and the topological charge \mathcal{Q},

## Training

The training loop is implemented in [` utils/training_utils.py `](utils/training_utils.py).

To train the sampler on a 2D U(1) gauge model using the parameters specified in [` bin/train_configs.json`](bin/train_configs.json):

```bash
$ python3 /path/to/l2hmc-qcd/l2hmc-qcd/train.py --json_file=/path/to/l2hmc-qcd/bin/train_configs.json
```

Or via the [` bin/train.sh `](bin/train.sh) script provided in [` bin/ `](bin/).

# Features

- **Distributed training**
  (via [`horovod`](https://github.com/horovod/horovod)): If `horovod` is installed, the model can be trained across multiple GPUs (or CPUs) by:

  ```bash
  #!/bin/bash
  
  TRAINER=/path/to/l2hmc-qcd/l2hmc-qcd/train.py
  JSON_FILE=/path/to/l2hmc-qcd/bin/train_configs.json
  
  horovodrun -np ${PROCS} python3 ${TRAINER} --json_file=${JSON_FILE}
  ```
