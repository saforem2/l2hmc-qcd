\begin{itemize}
  \item Monitor during training/inference:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Topological loss
      \item Plaquette loss
      \item Full loss (if different from above)
      \item Acceptance
      \item Tunneling rate
    \end{itemize}
  \item Get HMC results with above for varying step size
\end{itemize}

\section{07/10/2020}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Find out why loss increases
  \item Train at fixed beta and determine when loss stops decreasing
  \item Modify network (depth?) and compare loss, fixing all other run
    parameters
  \item Save configurations on each rank when saving checkpoints (horovod)
\end{itemize}

\section{07/17/2020}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Run MD (no accept/reject) for initial set of trajectories to avoid
    getting stuck
  \item Check that no runs in batch are getting stuck
  \item Check that plaq error is small
  \item Try training at \(\beta = 2\) for a while, then switch to \(\beta
    = 3\); compare to training at just \(\beta = 3\)
\end{itemize}

\section{07/24/2020}
\begin{itemize}
  \item MD seems to remove bias
  \item Training after MD seems to give lower loss function
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Check if reproducible
      \item See why lower (acceptance? tunneling?)
      \item See if results at end of training are consistent with inference
        from random start
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
