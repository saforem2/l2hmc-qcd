\subsection{Reversibility}%
\label{subsec:reversibility}
Previously, the reversibility checks were only being ran every \(\sim 1000\)
steps during inference, and failed to account for the fact that the L2HMC
updates also flip the direction.

This was modified as follows:
%
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Randomly choose the direction \(d\) to create the initial state
    \(\xi = (x, v, d)\).
  \item Run the dynamics and flip the direction:
    \begin{equation}
      \mathbf{FL} \xi = \mathbf{F}\xi^{\prime} = (x^{\prime}, v^{\prime}, - d)
    \end{equation}
  % \item Flip the direction and run the dynamics in the reverse direction:
  \item Run the dynamics and flip the direction again:
    \begin{equation}
      \mathbf{FL} \xi^{\prime} = \mathbf{F} \xi^{\prime\prime} =
      (x^{\prime\prime}, v^{\prime\prime}, d)
    % \mathbf{F}\xi^{\prime} = (x^{\prime}, v^{\prime}, -d) \rightarrow
    % \xi^{\prime\prime} = (x^{\prime\prime}, v^{\prime\prime}, -d)
  \end{equation}
  \item Check the difference:
    \begin{align}
      \delta x &= x - x^{\prime\prime} \\
      \delta v &= v - v^{\prime\prime}
    \end{align}
\end{enumerate}
%
Following this new procedure, we observe reversibility violations which may
indicate a deeper problem with the algorithm.

% \subsection{Symplectic}
% In addition to reversibility, we require our sampler to be \emph{symplectic}.

% \subsection{Enforcing the gauge condition}%
% \label{subsec:gauge_condition}
% In addition to the reversibility violations described above, an additional
% minor bug in the code was also discovered.
% %
% When running the L2HMC algorithm on the \(2D\) \(U(1)\) lattice gauge model, we
% must enforce that the position coordinate \(x\) remains in \(U(1)\).
% %
% Since we are working with the angle \(x = \phi\) directly, this is done by
% taking
% %
% \begin{equation}
%   x = \mod(x, 2\pi).
% \end{equation}
% %
% Previously, this was being enforced following each update step (following the
% accept/reject step) before passing the new configuration back into the network.
