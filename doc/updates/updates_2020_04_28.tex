\subsection{Additional changes to loss function}%
\label{subsec:additional_changes_to_loss_fn}
%
Instead of working with the mixed loss function,
\(\ell_{\lambda_{\mathcal{Q}}}(\xip, \xi, A(\xip|\xi))\) from
Eq.\ref{eq:ell_lambda}, we can focus exclusively on the second term, which is
directly related to the tunneling rate.
%
The equation then becomes

% TODO: Include both ell_p and ell_q functions with separate weights in
% `master` loss function
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{align}
  \ell_{\lambda_{\Q}}\left(\xip, \xi, A(\xip|\xi)\right) 
  &= - \frac{\delta_{\Q}\cdot A(\xi^{\prime}|\xi)}{\lambda_{\Q}^{2}}\\
  &= - {\left(\frac{{\mathcal{Q}^{\prime} -
  \mathcal{Q}}}{\lambda_\mathcal{Q}}\right)}^{2}\cdot
    A(\xi^{\prime}|\xi)
\end{align}
