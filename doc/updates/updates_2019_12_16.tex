All of the following results were trained using Horovod on COOLEY for
$1\times10^5$ training steps ($2\times$  previous training length).
%

As a measure of how well the trained sampler performs, we can introduce the
\emph{tunneling rate} ($\gamma$), as
%
\begin{equation}
  \gamma = \frac{1}{M}\sum_{m=1}^{M} |\mathcal{Q}^{(m+1)} - \mathcal{Q}^{(m)}|
\end{equation}
%
where $\mathcal{Q} \in \mathbb{Z}$ is the topological charge, and $M$ denotes
the number of accept/reject steps the sampler was ran for.
%
This tells us the amount by which we can expect the topological charge to
change per step, and is a useful metric for measuring how well the sampler is
able to explore different topological sectors.
