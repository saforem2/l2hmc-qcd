Gradient descent can be used for fine-tuning the weights in such {\textquotedblleft}autoencoder{\textquotedblright} networks, but this works well only if the initial weights are close to a good solution. We describe an effective way of initializing the weights that allows deep autoencoder networks to learn low-dimensional codes that work much better than principal components analysis as a tool to reduce the dimensionality of data.},

 abstractNote={We present a general-purpose method to train Markov chain Monte
Carlo kernels, parameterized by deep neural networks, that converge and mix
quickly to their target distribution. Our method generalizes Hamiltonian Monte
Carlo and is trained to maximize expected squared jumped distance, a proxy for
mixing speed. We demonstrate large empirical gains on a collection of simple
but challenging distributions, for instance achieving a 106× improvement in
effective sample size in one case, and mixing when standard HMC makes no
measurable progress in a second. Finally, we show quantitative and qualitative
gains on a real-world task: latent-variable generative modeling. We release an
open source TensorFlow implementation of the algorithm.},

 title={Generative Adversarial Networks},
 url={http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661},
 abstractNote={We propose a new framework for estimating generative models via
               an adversarial process, in which we simultaneously train two
               models: a generative model G that captures the data
               distribution, and a discriminative model D that estimates the
               probability that a sample came from the training data rather
               than G. The training procedure for G is to maximize the
               probability of D making a mistake. This framework corresponds to
               a minimax two-player game. In the space of arbitrary functions G
               and D, a unique solution exists, with G recovering the training
               data distribution and D equal to 1/2 everywhere. In the case
               where G and D are defined by multilayer perceptrons, the entire
               system can be trained with backpropagation. There is no need for
               any Markov chains or unrolled approximate inference networks
               during either training or generation of samples. Experiments
               demonstrate the potential of the framework through qualitative
               and quantitative evaluation of the generated samples.},

 abstractNote={How can we perform effcient
 inference and learning in directed probabilistic models, in the presence of
continuous latent variables with intractable posterior distributions, and large
datasets? We introduce a stochastic variational inference and learning
algorithm that scales to large datasets and, under some mild differentiability
conditions, even works in the intractable case. Our contributions is two-fold.
First, we show that a reparameterization of the variational lower bound yields
a lower bound estimator that can be straightforwardly optimized using standard
stochastic gradient methods. Second, we show that for i.i.d.  datasets with
continuous latent variables per datapoint, posterior inference can be made
especially efﬁcient by ﬁtting an approximate inference model (also called a
recognition model) to the intractable posterior using the proposed lower bound
estimator. Theoretical advantages are reﬂected in experimental results.},
